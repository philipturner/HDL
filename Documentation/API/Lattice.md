# Lattice

> TODO: Document somewhere that the `Lattice` DSL is not thread-safe.

The following keywords may be called inside a `Lattice`.

```swift
protocol Basis
Cubic: Basis
Hexagonal: Basis
```

Coordinate spaces for defining vectors in.

```swift
Bounds { SIMD3<Float> }
Bounds { 10 * h + 10 * k + 10 * l } // Cubic
Bounds { 10 * h + 10 * (h + 2 * k) + 10 * l } // Hexagonal
```

Sets the working set of crystal unit cells. The box spans from the world origin `[0, 0, 0]` the specified vector. This must be called in the top-level scope, before any `Volume` keywords.

For hexagonal crystals, the bounds are a cuboid defined by transforming the input vector. It is mapped from h/k/l space to h/h2k/l space. This allows the base lattice to be cartesian, similar to cubic. The quantity in each axis direction must be an integer.

```swift
Constant(ConstantType) { MaterialType }
ConstantType.hexagon // Hexagonal - hexagon side length
ConstantType.prism   // Hexagonal - prism height
ConstantType.square  // Cubic - square side length

// Query the lattice constant for diamond.
let latticeConstant = Constant(.square) { .elemental(.carbon) }
```

Values of the lattice constants, for use in custom geometry processing code.

The hexagonal lattice constants are not the exact energy minima. Rather, they are scaled to align with cubic (111) surfaces.

```swift
// Lattice vectors originate from the smallest repeatable unit of crystal. For
// cubic crystals, they are edges of a cube. For hexagonal crystals, they are
// sides of a hexagonal prism. The vectors aren't always orthogonal, so they are
// internally translated to nanometers before applying transforms.

// Hexagonal crystals are sometimes described with four unit vectors: h, k, i,
// and l. The 'i' vector is redundant and equals -h - k, creating a set of 3
// vectors symmetric around the perimeter of a hexagon. However, for the HDL, it
// can make representation more concise.
Lattice<Hexagonal> { h, k, l in
  // h + k + i == 0
  let i = -h - k
}

// Another helpful technique, which makes Hexagonal more similar to Cubic, is to
// replace 'k' with something orthogonal to 'h'. The coordinate basis has
// changed from h/k/l to h/h + 2k/l.
Lattice<Hexagonal> { h, k, l in
  // [3 * h, 2 * h2k, 2 * l] forms something close to a cube.
  let h2k = h + 2 * k
  ...
  
  Volume {
    Plane { -h }
    Plane { -h2k }
    Plane { -l }
    
    Origin { 3 * h + 2 * (h2k + l) }
    Plane { h }
    Plane { h2k }
    Plane { l }
    ...
  }
}
```

Unit vectors representing the crystal's basis.

```swift
Material { MaterialType }
```

Specifies the atom types to fill the lattice with, and the lattice constant. This must be called in the top-level scope.
