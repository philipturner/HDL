# Volume

The following keywords may be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Concave { }
```

Scope where every plane's "one" volume merges through AND in [disjunctive normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form). Upon exiting this scope, the added planes remain. This must be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Convex { }
```

Scope where every plane's "one" volume merges through OR in [disjunctive normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form). Upon exiting this scope, the added planes remain. This must be called inside a `Volume`.

```swift
Origin { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Translates the origin by a vector relative to the current origin. Modifications to the origin are undone when leaving the current scope. This may not be called in the top-level scope.

```swift
Plane { SIMD3<Float> }
```

Adds a plane to the stack. The plane will be combined with other planes, and used for selecting/deleting atoms.

A `Plane` divides the `Bounds` into two sections. The "one" volume is the side the normal vector points toward. The "zero" volume is the side the normal points away from. The "one" volume contains the atoms modified during a `Replace`. When planes combine into a `Concave`, only the crystal unit cells common to every plane's "one" volume are modifiable.

```swift
enum ReplaceType {
  case .atom(Element)
  case .empty
}

Replace { ReplaceType }
```

Transmute the atoms in the selected volume to a different atom type.

To delete atoms, use `Replace { .empty }`. Removed atoms cannot be restored by a subsequent `Replace`.

```swift
Volume { }
```

Encapsulates a set of planes, so that everything inside the scope is removed from the stack upon exiting. This must be called inside `Lattice` and may be called inside another `Volume`.
