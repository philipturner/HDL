import Dispatch

// Pseudocode of traversal algorithm:
//
// Each parent thread gets allocated n * 8 child threads, where n is the cell
// count in the parent thread. Each possible child up to 8 cells allocated.
//
// Each parent thread gets allocated a destination region of n * 8 cells,
// where n is the cell count in the parent thread.
//
// All space is allocated upfront in a large array, and written to in a
// thread-safe manner. The Swift 'Array' data type is never used.

// After a pass in the high levels, the source thread and source cell objects
// must be deleted. In the low levels, the source thread doesn't perish
// because we just directly recurse all remaining levels of the octree in
// order.
//
// A function takes a single cell in, and returns an array of threads. If
// the array has count one, it doesn't fork off the parent thread. The
// overhead of array creation is relatively negligible at the high levels,
// but vastly simplifies the implementation.
//
// The in-place atom buffer survives across passes / levels. It is
// overwritten in-place by several threads, concurrently. While individual
// threads may not access it contiguously, the memory operations should
// theoretically be atomic / safe.
//
// A single task on the dispatch queue will be multiple function calls into
// the tree traversal function. However, on first glance, the structure of
// the calling loop might make it possible to fully inline. Don't worry
// about ensuring it's fully inlined, as the overhead at high levels is low.

// Instead of passing an offset'd pointer into each child function call, as
// with previous algorithms (and likely the lower levels), we retain a
// reference to the global base address. Instead, we identify the location
// by a range. This range can recalculate the atom count too, simplifying the
// amount of data passed between functions.
//
// 'Cell' owns the range.

// ## Loop Over Levels of the Tree
//
// levelSize specified in this loop, which is the source of truth. No
// division by 2 for child functions. This is a point of divergence with the
// lower levels. The 'traverse' function should accept levelSize as an
// argument.
//
// High-level data structure containing [Thread]:
//
// Start with a single Thread, and a single Cell scoped to the entire octree.
// Invoke this thread with DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform, to simplify the
// code. All passes now use concurrent dispatch.
//
// Inside each dispatch task, the number of cells is unpacked. Create a new
// list of output cells. Sort them into ones belonging to the parent thread,
// and a separate array of child Thread objects. Write the results to a
// global buffer in a thread-safe way.
//
// In a post-processing part of the code, after the concurrent dispatch,
// scan the global buffer of threads and cells. Eliminate any parent threads
// that now have zero cells. Eliminate any allocated child threads that were
// never materialized.
//
// Thread-safe data structure for results:
//
// Order of cells in a cell buffer could be inconsequential. A cell's range
// always points to the same atoms, no matter where you store the cell in
// memory. What's important is the Thread, which must reference the cell
// objects.
//
// This process is especially tricky, because one thread could reference many
// non-contiguous patches of atoms in the list. Does this mean many
// non-contiguous patches of Cell objects? Not exactly.
//
// We can probably use a simple sequential scan-compact algorithm. Process
// each thread in order from first to last. Update the thread based on some
// running counters. Forget the current Thread object and move on to the next.
